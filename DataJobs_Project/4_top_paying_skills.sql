Key Takeaways:
1. Hybrid Skillsets Pay More: The highest earners tend to combine data analysis with engineering, cloud, and machine learning skills.
2. Beyond SQL & Excel: While foundational, traditional skills like SQL are not the highest earners anymore â€” tools like PySpark, Databricks, GitLab, and Airflow push salaries higher.
3. Cloud and MLOps Are the Future: Skills involving scalability, deployment, and automation are commanding increasing compensation.
